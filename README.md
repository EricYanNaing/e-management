HOW TO RUN IT 

npm install for both backend and frontend folders. 
nodemon app.js to run backend. 
npm run dev for frontend.

but first you need to create the data base in mongo db. please make sure to do it.

when mongo server is connected, you can see the result.

Please contact me if you have any difficulties when setting up the project. 

Thank you.
